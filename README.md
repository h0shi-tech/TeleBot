# Telegram Bot Basics
This repository provides basic concepts for developing Telegram bots using Python. The code is organized into three main files:

## main.py
This file contains the fundamental concepts for creating Telegram bots. It covers the essential components such as handling messages, commands, and user interactions. Use this file as a starting point for building your Telegram bot.

### Usage:
- bash
- Copy code
- python main.py

## sqlwork.py
sqlwork.py focuses on integrating SQLite3 database functionality into a Telegram bot. It covers basic concepts for creating, querying, and managing a database within the context of a Telegram bot. If you plan to store and retrieve data in your bot, refer to this file for guidance.

### Usage:
- bash
- Copy code
- python sqlwork.py

## weatherbot.py
weatherbot.py is a practical example of a Telegram bot that provides weather information using a JSON integration. It demonstrates how to fetch data from an external API (in JSON format) and present it to the user within a Telegram bot. Use this file as a reference for incorporating external data into your bot.

### Usage:
- bash
- Copy code
- python weatherbot.py

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- python-telegram-bot
- SQLite3 (for sqlwork.py)
- External API key (for weatherbot.py)
